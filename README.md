# FlappyBird-Clone
This is a simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using Unity and C#. The game recreates the original mechanics â€” the player controls a bird, tapping to keep it in the air while avoiding pipes. This project helped me strengthen my skills in Unity game development, physics-based movement, collision detection, and game state management.
